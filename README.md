### *Election-Audit Summary*
Because all of our variables are generic, we can add/edit/remove counties as well as candidates in order to apply this code to any election. Depending on how many candidates we have, we might want to alter the output into more of a Data Frame in order to more clearly see a larger list organized in a more digestible format.
